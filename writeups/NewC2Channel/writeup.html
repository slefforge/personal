    <p>This one was a fairly straightforward forensics challenge, but the solution looked quite pretty so I wanted to make a writeup anyways.</p>
    <p>The first thing I noticed when I opened up the provided pcap file in Wireshark was that there seems to be some odd looking data being passed in to the 'page' parameter of the HTTP GET requests.</p>
    <img src="pcap.png" style="width:50%;height:50%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>At first the pattern isn't obvious, but if I double click on a random packet, I can see something interesting.</p>
    <img src="packet1.png" style="width:50%;height:50%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>When the data form this packet is arranged is 16 character rows, we can see that the strange looking data spells out a big letter 'a'.</p>
    <p>And if I open up the next packet, I can see that the ASCII-art is shifted one column to the left.</p>
    <img src="packet2.png" style="width:50%;height:50%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>At this point I had a suspicion that if I looked at each of these packets in sequence, it would spell out a hidden message.</p>
    <p>But I didn't really feel like doing this by hand in Wireshark, so I wrote a script to play out this animation for me.</p>
    <p>First, I extracted the relevant data with the following command:</p>
    <p><i>tshark -r playback.pcap -T fields -e http.request.uri http.request.method eq "GET" > extracted_data.txt</i></p>
    <p>Then I animated the packet data with this script:</p>
    <img src="script.png" style="width:50%;height:50%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>This process produced this very satisfying looking result.</p>
