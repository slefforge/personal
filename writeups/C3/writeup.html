    <p>C3 was one of the more controversial challenges of picoctf2024. I think this can be attributed to the guesswork required to solve the second half of the challenge.</p>
    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>Anyway, here is the given encoder:</p>
    <img src="encoder.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>So here we see that for each character, it is looking up index (cur-prev)%40 in lookup2 and adding that to the output.</p>
    <p>Thus, we can iterate through the output ourselves and for each character, calculate (secret-prev)%40 checking at which index the character appears in lookup2.</p>
    <p>Here, secret is an integer representing the which index of lookup1 that contains the secret character.</p>
    <p>But you'll notice that in order to solve for secret, we need to know prev.</p>
    <p>It is given that prev for our first character is 0.</p>
    <p>Feeling lazy and not wanting to do math, I decided to modify the encoder to print out (secret-prev)%40, secret-prev, and prev for each character and search for a pattern. Here I used the test string "honey".</p>
    <img src="logs.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>After staring at this output for some time, I realized the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(secret-prev)%40[i] is already known for all i</li>
        <li>secret-prev[i] = (secret-prev)%40[i] when (secret-prev)%40[i]+prev[i-1] < 40</li>
        <li>secret-prev[i] = (secret-prev)%40[i]-40 when (secret-prev)%40[i]+prev[i-1] >= 40</li>
        <li>prev[i] = the sum of secret-prev in range (0, i-1)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given these rules I was able to calculate secret-prev and prev for each character. Here is my script for doing that. (The rules may be a little more coherent in this format as well.)</p>

    <p>The mathematicians reading now probably realize that if I know the quantities (secret-prev) and (prev) for each character, the secret isn't so secret anymore.</p>

    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <img src="pythontwo.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>Here is the plaintext. It's a python 2 script that reads in a file, and spits out the characters that are at perfect cube indices [1, 8, 27, 64, ...]</p>
    <p>The big question is, what file are you supposed to feed this script? The answer is itself.</p>
    <img src="flag.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>And per the instructions you need to wrap the final flag yourself, yielding</p>
    <i>picoCTF{adlibs}</i>
    <p>If you can believe it, guessing which file you were supposed to input took longer than part 1 for many people including myself.</p>
