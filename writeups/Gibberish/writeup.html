    <p>After poking around in Wireshark for a bit, I saw that many of the packets in the provided pcap file contained information about keys being pressed.</p>
    <img src="packet.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>These key presses don't follow the typical typing pattern where one key is pressed and released, then another is pressed and released, etc.</p>
    <p>Instead, one chord of keys is being pressed and released before moving on to the next.</p>
    <p>I've thought a lot about alternative typing methods and have even abandoned qwerty myself, so with the help of the first hint, I recognized this input to be that of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype", target=”_blank”>stenotype</a>.</p>
    <p>Well, not exactly. Stenotypes don't have keys like 'C' and 'V', as the above input shows. This input was instead created on a qwerty keyboard with something like <a href="https://www.openstenoproject.org/plover/", target=”_blank”>Plover</a>.</p>
    <p>Before we can do any kind of processing on this data, we need to download it and clean it up a bit.</p>
    <p><i>tshark -r keyboard.pcapng -Y 'usbhid.data' -Y "usb.dst == host" -T fields -e usbhid.data > raw.txt</i></p>
    <img src="raw.png" style="width:10%;height:10%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>Here is a snippet of the data.</p>
    <p>It doesn't look like much at first, but we can already see the formation of chords indicative of stenography, so we know we're on the right track.</p>

    <p>This seems to be the mapping used to encode the key presses.</p>
    <img src="cleanscript.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>I wrote this script using the above mapping to try and create a nicer text file to work with.</p>
    <img src="clean.png" style="width:5%;height:5%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>And here is the result. Now we can clearly see exactly what this person was inputting into their keyboard.</p>
    <p>The only thing left to do is turn these inputs into readable text.</p>
    <p>The simplest way I could think to do this was to find some qwerty-stenography software and write a script that performs these inputs locally.</p>
    <p>I found <a href="https://www.openstenoproject.org/demo/", target=”_blank”>this web demo</a> that seems to work. I noticed it doesn't handle backspaces the way I'd expect.</p>
    <p>Any important data parts of the file that contain backspaces can be manually adjusted so it's as if the writer never made their error in the first place.</p>
    <img src="botscript.png" style="width:30%;height:30%;border: 5px solid #555;">
    <p>Here's my script to press all the keys. I just ran this, opened the steno demo, and waited for something that looked like a flag.</p>

    <p>And we have our flag, <i>utflag{learning_stenography_on_a_qwerty_keyboard_is_quite_difficult}</i></p>
